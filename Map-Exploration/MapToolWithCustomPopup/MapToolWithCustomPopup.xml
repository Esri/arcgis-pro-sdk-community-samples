            Called the first time the pop-up content is viewed. This is good practice when you may show a pop-up for multiple items at a time. 
            This allows you to delay generating the html content until the item is actually viewed.

            This sample shows how to author custom pop-up content to display in a pop-up window. 
            In this example we are generating html and javascript code using the Google Charts api to create rich and interactive content in the pop-up. 
            This example also shows how to add your own commands to the bottom of the pop-up window.
