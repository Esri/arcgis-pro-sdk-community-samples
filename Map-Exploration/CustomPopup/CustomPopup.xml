             This sample shows how to author custom pop-up content to display in a pop-up window. 
             In this example we are generating html and javascript code using the Google Charts api to create rich and interactive content in the pop-up. 
             This example also shows how to add your own commands to the bottom of the pop-up window. 
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             1. In Visual Studio click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
             2. Click Start button to open ArcGIS Pro.
             3. ArcGIS Pro will open. 
             4. Open a map view. Click on the Add-In tab on the ribbon.
             5. Within this tab there is a Custom Pop-up tool. Click it to activate the tool.
             6. In the map click and drag a box around the features you want to identify.
             7. The pop-up window should display and you should see a table showing the values for all the visible numeric fields in the layer. 
             It will also display a pie chart for those same fields.
             8. As you click through the pop-up results the content is being generated dynamically for each feature.
             9. The pop-up window also has a custom command "Show statistics" at the bottom of the window that when clicked shows additional information about the feature.
