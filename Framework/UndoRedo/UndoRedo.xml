            Button to illustrate how operations can be added to different OperationManagers.

            <remarks>
            In ArcGIS Pro does not contain a single application undo/redo stack. In general, undo operations are organized per Pane and DockPane.
            
            See <see cref="T:ArcGIS.Desktop.Framework.OperationManager"/> for additional information on the OperationManager and undo/redo stacks.

            <summary>
            This sample demonstrates how to add operations onto the undo/redo stack.   
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            ArcGIS Pro does not contain a single undo/redo operation stack for the application; it has multiple undo/redo stacks. Each pane and dockpane decides how it's 
            own operations are managed. In many cases, each pane and dockpane has it's own OperationManager; however in some cases they may 
            elect to share a single OperationManager.  For example, operations added to map A are not visible to map B (becuase they have different
            OperationManagers), but two panes showing the same map will show the same operations as they share the same OperationManager. 
            
            When a window becomes active, its OperationManager is requested and connected to the undo/redo user interface. 
            <para>
            This sample contains a dockpane which has its own OperationManager.   The two buttons at the top of the dockpane illustrate how to 
            create an undo/redo operation and add it to the OperationManager.  The third button at the top of the dockpane illustrates a 
            compositeOperation which allows many operations to be grouped into a single composite operation.   The 4 buttons at the bottom of the 
            dockpane manipulate the undo/redo stack - performing undo and redo actions; remove undo actions and clearing the stacks.

            1. Open this solution in Visual Studio.  
            2. Click the Build menu. Then select Build Solution.
            3. Click Start button to open ArcGIS Pro. ArcGIS Pro will open.
            4. Open a project containing data.  
            5. Click on the Add-in tab and see that 2 buttons are added to a Undo_Redo group.
            6. Click the "Show Sample DockPane" button in the Undo_Redo group.  The Sample dockpane will be displayed
            7. Ensure that a map is open.  
            8. Use the Fixed Zoom In and Fixed Zoom Out buttons to see zoom in and zoom out operations added to the undo stack for the sample dockpane.
            9. Use the Undo and Redo buttons to undo and redo the operations.  Use the Remove Operation button to pop an operation (without undoing it).  
             Use the Clear All Operations button to clear all the operations of a particular category from the stack.
