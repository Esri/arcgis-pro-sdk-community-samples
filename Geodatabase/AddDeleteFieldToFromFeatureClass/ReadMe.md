1. Download the Community Sample data (see under the "Resources" section for downloading sample data).  The sample data contains a project called "FeatureTest.aprx" with data suitable for this sample.  Make sure that the Sample data is unzipped in c:\data and "C:\Data\FeatureTest\FeatureTest.aprx" is available.  
1. Open this solution in Visual Studio 2015.  
1. Click the build menu and select Build Solution.

1. Open the "C:\Data\FeatureTest\FeatureTest.aprx" project.  
1. Open the "Contents Dock Pane" by selecting the View Tab on the Pro ribbon and then clicking the Contents button to open the Contents dock pane".  
1. Click on the Add-in tab and verify that a "FeatureClass Schema" group was added.
